Duncan the Toast Ghost

Duncan is a ghost
He enjoys eating toast
His self he can't restrain
When he sees a multi-grain 

He spreads the peanut butter
Sitting happy in the gutter
He dollops marmalade
Resting cheerful in the shade

And then on one fine day
As Duncan prepared his brekky tray
His pal did suggest
That Nutella was the best
